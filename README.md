# DarkSoulsMucker
Shoots Random inputs to Dark Souls while you play to mess you up

Requires AutoHotKey and Python interpreter


As is the project was built for a Dark Souls 3 playthrough but could theoretically work on many different games with some changes to Joystick.ahk

!!There is currently no killswitch added so be careful of alt-tabbing mid loop!!

For larger or smaller gaps in time between outputs change the range of time_interval in main.py to whatever you want in seconds (default 10 to 20s)
