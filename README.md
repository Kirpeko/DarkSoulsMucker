# DarkSoulsMucker
Shoots Random inputs to Dark Souls while you play to mess you up

Requires AutoHotKey to make changes to the script

Just run the application once you are in the game and the script will give you a few seconds to tab back into the game before executing the loop. The application works outside of the game so make sure to use the kill command before alt-tabbing.

Kill app command = ctrl+k
(If done during execution of certain commands in the loop can sometimes not work so always press a few times and test to make sure the program is killed first)


As is the project was built for a Dark Souls 3 playthrough but could theoretically work on many different games with some changes to Joystick.ahk


For larger or smaller gaps in time between outputs change the range of time_interval in Joystick.ahk to whatever you want in seconds (default 10 to 20s) and compile for a new .exe
