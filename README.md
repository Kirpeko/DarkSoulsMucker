# DarkSoulsMucker
Shoots Random inputs to Dark Souls while you play to mess you up

Requires AutoHotKey to make changes to the script

Kill app command = ctrl+k


As is the project was built for a Dark Souls 3 playthrough but could theoretically work on many different games with some changes to Joystick.ahk


For larger or smaller gaps in time between outputs change the range of time_interval in Joystick.ahk to whatever you want in seconds (default 10 to 20s) and compile for a new .exe
